X Scam Eyes â€” a Chrome extension for safe browsing on X (Twitter). It highlights suspicious or paid influencers/projects, displaying labels with proof links (if available). All default users are synced from a public defaults.json file on [x-scam-eyes-data](https://github.com/nonhash/x-scam-eyes-data) repository, while local changes allow temporarily hiding entries or adding custom notes.

Goal: quickly filter informational noise.
